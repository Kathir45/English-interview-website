                <h2>What is Interview?</h2>
                <h6>An interview is a formal meeting where someone asks you questions to find out more about you, your skills, experiences, and qualifications. It's usually done when you're applying for a job or a school program. The interviewer wants to learn if you're a good fit for the position or program, so they ask you different questions to understand your background and abilities. It's a way for them to get to know you better and see if you're the right person for the opportunity. Interviews can be nerve-wracking, but preparing well can help you feel more confident. Let me know if you need tips on how to ace an interview!</h6><br><hr>

                <h2>Common Steps/Rounds involved in Interviews</h2><br>
                <h6> In a typical interview, there are several common steps involved to assess the candidate's suitability for the position. Here are some of the usual steps you might encounter during an interview:<br><br>

1. **Application Review:** The interviewer may go over your resume, cover letter, and any other application materials you submitted.<br><br>

2. **Phone Screening:** Some interviews start with a brief phone call to discuss your background and interest in the position.<br><br>

3. **In-Person Interview:** This is where you meet face-to-face with the interviewer or a panel of interviewers. They'll ask you questions about your experience, skills, and motivations.<br><br>

4. **Behavioral Questions:** These questions ask you to provide examples of how you handled specific situations in the past to assess your problem-solving and interpersonal skills.<br><br>

5. **Technical Questions:** For technical roles, you might be asked to demonstrate your knowledge and skills in the field through practical questions or exercises.<br><br>

6. **Case Studies or Presentations:** In some interviews, you may be given a case study or asked to prepare and deliver a presentation on a given topic.<br><br>

7. **Questions for the Interviewer:** Towards the end of the interview, you'll likely have the chance to ask your own questions about the role, company, or team.<br><br>

8. **Follow-Up:** After the interview, it's common to send a thank-you email to express your appreciation and reiterate your interest in the position.<br><br>

These steps can vary depending on the organization and the type of position you're applying for. It's essential to prepare thoroughly for each step to present yourself in the best possible light. Let me know if you need more information on any of these steps!</h6>
